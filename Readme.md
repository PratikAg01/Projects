# Spotify Recommender System

## Introduction

This project aims to build a Spotify recommender system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to recommend songs to users based on their listening habits and preferences.

## Data

The data used in this project is obtained from Kaggle. This includes information on songs, artists, and audio features such as danceability, energy, and valence.

## Methodology

The recommender system will be built using various machine learning techniques such as collaborative filtering and k-mean clustering.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
  Usage

---

1.  Clone the repository
2.  Install the required libraries

3.  Replace the `client_id` and `client_secret` placeholders in the `auth.py` file with your own credentials.
4.  Run the `main.py` file to generate recommendations

## Results

The generated recommendations will be saved in a CSV file in the `results` folder. The file will contain the recommended song's name, artist and album name.

## Conclusion

The Spotify recommender system is a powerful tool that can help users discover new music and artists based on their listening habits and preferences. The machine learning techniques used in this project enable the system to recommend songs that are similar to the ones a user already likes.
